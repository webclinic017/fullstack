                        <p>As well as our own multi award-winning trading platform, TigerWit clients can also trade
                            using MT4. The MetaTrader 4 platform, most commonly known as MT4, is one of the most popular
                            trading platforms and is trusted by traders all over the world. <br>
                            Originally launched in 2005 by the Metaquotes Software Corp., MT4’s popularity has never
                            waned and is still more commonly used than its successor MT5. This is partly due to its ease
                            of use and customizability, as well as its integration of Expert Advisors (EAs). <br>
                            Traders can place orders using the MetaTrader 4 platform or use its live rates to place
                            instant market execution orders. The MetaTrader 4 software is available to use in mobile and
                            desktop versions, allowing traders the flexibility to monitor the market and place trades
                            and orders the way that suits them. <br>
                            MT4 also allows users to access charts, indicators, and other helpful trading tools, many of
                            which have been created by other users of the trading platform. This interaction and user
                            generated tools are key factors in the platform’s popularity. EAs are an example of this and
                            are commonly used to automate trading according to the users’ risk/reward appetite and
                            market condition preference.

                        <p>EAs, or Expert Advisors, are often referred to as Forex Trading Robots that can allow users
                            to predetermine the conditions and levels that they would like trade in and allow the system
                            to do the work for them. Many consider the decision-making part of trading to be one of the
                            most difficult factors as emotion can often take control. But by having a clear trading
                            strategy in mind before starting to trade, EAs can be programmed to open and close deals on
                            your behalf, taking emotion and human error out of the equation. These are just some of the
                            reasons that make traders download MetaTrader 4.<br>
                            When looking to use the automated trading feature of EA software, you can pre-set the
                            parameters that you would like to trade under. If these market conditions align, the
                            computerized system will place or close trades according to your needs. By setting EAs into
                            action, traders can save time and let the system do the work for them… However, it is
                            strongly recommended that all Expert Advisors are back tested before being used. Back
                            testing allows you to see how a certain EA or trading strategies would have performed under
                            historical financial data. Whilst this is recommended, it is also worth noting that past
                            performance is not a reliable indication of the future of any given financial market.
